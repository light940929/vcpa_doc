# 6.2 Choose which workflow to use

**VCPA allows user to process either a WGS or WES sample using the latest human reference genome \(hg38\). For WGS, VCPA provides two options: with or without mapping. Below are the three VCPA workflow options that users can choose from:**

* **VCPA\_WES\_hg38\_from\_mapping\_to\_variant\_call.sh -**  this is the WES pipeline that includes steps from mapping to variant call using GATK \(i.e. steps 0, 1, 2a and 2b in the overview figure in the Introduction session\)
* **VCPA\_WGS\_hg38\_from\_mapping\_to\_variant\_call.sh -**  this is the WGS pipeline that includes steps from mapping to variant call using GATK \(i.e. steps 0, 1, 2a and 2b in the overview figure in the Introduction session\)
* **VCPA\_WGS\_hg38\_from\_markdup\_to\_variant\_call.sh -**  this is the WGS pipeline that excludes mapping, but includes other steps of VCPA \(i.e. steps 1, 2a and 2b in the overview figure in the Introduction session\)

**Users can choose the workflow by doing this:**

```text
cp bin/${PROJECT_WORKFLOW}.sh bin/${PROJECT_WORKFLOW}_aws.sh
```

{% hint style="info" %}
PROJECT\_WORKFLOW is the one of the three .sh file chosen from the above.
