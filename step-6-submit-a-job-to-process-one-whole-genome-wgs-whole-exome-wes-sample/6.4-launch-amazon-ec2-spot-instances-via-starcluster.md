# 6.4 Launch Amazon EC2 Spot Instances via starcluster

**Finally, users can launch a Amazon EC2 Spot Instance via starcluster, to process a WGS / WES sample using the selected workflow from section 6.2. The following steps are required:**

1\) Users need to copy the SGE plugins into the starcluster folder in the tracking database instance:

```text
 cp -r /path/to/vcpa-pipeline/plugins ~/.starcluster/
```

2\) Go into the VCPA pipeline bin folder:

```text
 cd /path/to/vcpa-pipeline/bin
```

3\) Users can launch the Amazon EC2 spot instance to process one sample using the following command:

```text
 starcluster start -c smallcluster --bid=${price} -U ${worflow_path} -P ${HOST_PREFIX}-${PROJECT_ID}-${SAMPLE_NAME}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
price: bidding cost of the instance

workflow\_path: /path/to/vcpa-pipeline/bin/${PROJECT\_WORKFLOW}\_aws.sh

HOST\_PREFIX: host name for the tracking database

project\_id: this is the project ID outputted by Section 3.2

sample\_name: sample name \(note this needs to match the sample name of the input file in the S3 bucket\)
{% endhint %}
